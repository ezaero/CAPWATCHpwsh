# Azure Functions deployment exclusions
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file excludes the Modules/ directory from deployment to stay under
# the 150MB Azure Functions size limit. Modules are uploaded to Azure Storage instead
# and loaded at runtime.
#
# For module setup instructions, see: DEPLOYMENT.md (Step 2: PowerShell Module Setup)
# 
# Module Loading Strategy:
#   - Modules excluded here (Modules/) are uploaded to Azure Storage 
#   - Runtime loading handled by shared/Load-Modules.ps1
#   - Primary dependency management via requirements.psd1
